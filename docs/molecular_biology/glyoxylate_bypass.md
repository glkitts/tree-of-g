### What?

"As shown in Figure 1, the glyoxylate bypass siphons carbon away from the main sequence of the TCA cycle at isocitrate, immediately before the commencement of oxidative decarboxylation. The glyoxylate shunt generates succinate and malate, which are subsequently oxidized to yield fumarate and oxaloacetate (respectively), so it also provides some energy to the cell. However, this is not an all-or-none switch between competing pathways; even during growth on acetate, flux is partitioned between the main sequence of TCA cycle reactions and the glyoxylate shunt, thereby maintaining a balance of energy and gluconeogenic precursor production.

###  Why and when?

- Allows cells to grow and reproduce under conditions of limited glucose or other carbon sources. Can use fatty acids rather than just glucose
- **Activating metabolites:** acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate
- **Inhibiting metabolites:** Glucose / 6-carbon sugars
	- Stimulates TCA to compete with glyoxylate for acetyl-CoA
- When acetyl-CoA accumulates in the cell, it can be converted into glyoxylate by the isocitrate lyase. 
- Subsequently leads to the formation of succinate and other four-carbon compounds, which can be used for energy production and biosynthesis. 
- The activation of the glyoxylate shunt allows cells to utilize acetyl-CoA as a source of carbon and energy, even in the absence of glucose or other traditional carbon sources.

The most expressed enzymes when the glyoxylate shunt is active are:

1.  Isocitrate lyase (ICL): This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the glyoxylate shunt, converting isocitrate into glyoxylate.
2.  Malate synthase (MLS): This enzyme converts glyoxylate into malate, which is an important intermediate in the glyoxylate shunt.
3.  Citrate synthase (CS): This enzyme converts citrate into isocitrate, which can then be used as a substrate for ICL.

These enzymes are key components of the glyoxylate shunt and are typically upregulated when the pathway is active, leading to an increase in the level of their expression. The increased expression of these enzymes can help to ensure that the glyoxylate shunt can function effectively and provide a source of carbon and energy for the cell.
