# The Tree of G

A collection of things useful to me, that might be of use to others.

## Welcome!

This is my digital garden, in its earliest stages. [What is a digital garden?](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#3-imperfection-&-learning-in-public)

Here I intend to collect tools, tips, and thoughts that were useful enough to me personally to record. I hope to use [learning in public](https://rajrajhans.com/2020/06/thinking-of-blog-as-digital-garden/) as a reason to keep this garden well-enough maintained that others can navigate it, while also letting it contain whichever content is most fitting to me. 

The specific topics of what I include here have yet to be decided. As of now I at least intend to include a collection of tools and databases of use during my work in microbiology molecular biology research, as well as findings in utilizing the R programming language for data analysis, visualization, and scientific figure generation.

- [[r_dataSci]] -  primarily contains code snippets and approaches using the R coding language in the context of molecular biology data analysis and visualization.
- [[color_palettes]] - notes on color palettes for different purposes in data visualization, optimal choices for colorblind and grayscale awareness, etc.
