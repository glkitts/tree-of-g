# The Tree of G

A collection of things useful to me, that might be useful to you. 

## Welcome!

This is my digital garden, albeit in its earliest stages. 

Here I intend to collect tools, tips, and thoughts that have been useful enough to me that I felt they were worth recording. 

The specific topics of what I include here have yet to be decided. As of now I at least intend to include a collection of tools and databases of use during my work in microbiology molecular biology research, as well as findings in utilizing the R programming language for data analysis, visualization, and scientific figure generation.
