# The Tree of G

A collection of things useful to me, maybe some can be useful for you.

## Welcome!

This is my digital garden, in its earliest stages. [What is a digital garden?](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#3-imperfection-&-learning-in-public)

Here I intend to collect tools, tips, and thoughts that were useful enough to me personally to record. I hope to use [learning in public](https://rajrajhans.com/2020/06/thinking-of-blog-as-digital-garden/) as a reason to keep this garden well-enough maintained that others can navigate it, while also letting it contain whichever content is most fitting to me.
